A weather app that tracks current and future hourly and daily forecast data such as:
* Temperature (Current/High/Low)
* Rain/Snow Chance
* Wind Speed
* UV Index
* Humidity

Built using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and the Visual Crossing Weather API. My main goal of this project was to better understand web accessibilities and client-side API integration.
